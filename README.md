# Snapshot Testing README

## Activity: Writing a Snapshot Test

We will write at least one snapshot test for UI regression testing in this activity. A regression is a return to a less developed form, useful when something that previously worked stops working or is no longer rendered on the page as desired. Snapshot testing helps prevent UI regression in applications.

## Setup

1. Open your working directory in the terminal.
2. Run create-react-app in your terminal to generate some starter code.

```shell
npx create-react-app my-app
